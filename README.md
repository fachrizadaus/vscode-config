# 🎨 VS Code Configuration

This is my personal **VS Code Setup**! 💻✨

I wanted to share my settings and extensions that I use to make me feel at home.

## What’s in here?
- **`settings.json`**: These are the tweaks that make my workspace just right.
- **`vscode-extensions.json`**: The must-have extensions I always rely on.

## How to use it
1. **Clone or Download** this repo to your local machine.
2. Copy the `settings.json` into your `.vscode/` folder in your project.
3. To install all my go-to extensions, run this in your terminal:
   
   ```bash
   cat vscode-extensions.json | jq -r '.extensions[]' | xargs -L 1 code --install-extension
   ```
